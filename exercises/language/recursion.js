/**
 * Trees are great. Some are even awesome.
 * 
 * This is a tree (according to some old-ass computer scientists):
 *   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)
 * 
 * Definitions:
 *   - A tree starts with a "Root" node at the "top" of the tree.
 *   - Every node has a name and an array of child nodes.
 *   - A tree can be of arbitrary depths.
 *   - "Leaf" nodes are simply nodes with no children.
 * 
 * getLeafNodes should return an array of leaf-node names
